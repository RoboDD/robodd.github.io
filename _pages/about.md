I am pursuing M.Sc. degree in Robotics at the University of Bristol, starting from September 2022. I received the B.Sc. degree with honours in Applied Mathematics from the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and University of Liverpool in July 2022. Everyone is warmly welcome to drop me an email to reach out!

My Research Interests
======

I have broad research interests in robotics. Now I am mainly interested in:

* Human-Robot Shared Autonomy
* Motion Planning, Dynamics and Control
* Mixed Reality (MR) and its application

Vision Statement
======

My long-term goal is to reduce heavy supervisory work from human operators and improve the capability of mobile robots to complete comprehensive missions. I am interested in applying both model-based, data-driven, or combinations of both approaches to solve the challenge. The novel human-robot control paradigm has wide applications in medical robotics, aerial robotics, and construction robotics, which can improve the level of autonomy of the next generation of robotics systems.
