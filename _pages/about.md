Hi! I am Ziniu WU. I am working on my MSc dissertation (Towards Human-in-the-loop Robot Learning with Mixed Reality-based Immersive Teleoperation) supervised by [Dr. Dandan Zhang](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/about) at the University of Bristol. Please find more about my current dissertation project [here](https://robodd.github.io/site/research/).

**I am actively looking for a PhD position in Robotics and AI!**

My Research Interests
======

I have broad research interests in robotics and spatial AI. Now I am mainly interested in:

* Human-in-the-loop Robot Learning
* Motion Planning, Dynamics and Control
* Mixed Reality (MR) and its application

Vision Statement
======

My long-term goal is to reduce heavy supervisory work from human operators and improve the capability of mobile robots to complete comprehensive missions. I am interested in applying both model-based, data-driven, or combinations of both approaches to solve the challenge. The novel human-robot control paradigm has wide applications in medical robotics, aerial robotics, and construction robotics, which can improve the level of autonomy of the next generation of robotics systems.
