<!--
Hi! I am Ziniu WU. I am doing a [Research Internship]() at the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research projects focus on [Bimanual Manipulation]() and [Imitation Learning](). I have completed my MSc dissertation, Mixed Reality-based Fully Immersive Teleoperation for Human-in-the-loop Robot Learning, supervised by [Dr. Dandan Zhang](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/about) at the [University of Bristol](). Please find more details about my dissertation project [here](https://robodd.github.io/site/research/).

<!--
I am an incoming PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bristol, working with Dr. Bahadir Kocer and Prof. Arthur Richards. My research mainly focuses on investigating continual learning for dynamical systems to enhance their adaptation and robustness in unconstructed and dynamic environments. 

I obtained an MSc in Robotics at the University of Bristol, UK in 2023. My MSc dissertation focused on Mixed Reality-based Fully Immersive Teleoperation for Human-in-the-loop Robot Learning, supervised by Dr. Dandan Zhang.

Before that, I received a BSc in Applied Mathematics from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and the University of Liverpool in 2022.

**I am actively looking for a PhD position in Robotics and AI!**
