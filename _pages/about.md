Hi there! I am Ziniu WU. I am a [Research Assistant]() in Embodied AI and Robotics at the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). Previously, I received an [MSc in Robotics]() at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and a [BSc in Applied Mathematics]() at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en).


<!--
Ziniu Wu is a first-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bristol, working with Dr. Bahadir Kocer and Prof. Arthur Richards. His research focuses on **Continual Learning for Dynamical Systems** to enhance their adaptation and robustness in unconstructed and dynamic environments. Previously, he received an MSc in Robotics at the University of Bristol and a BSc in Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool.
