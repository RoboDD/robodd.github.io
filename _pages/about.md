Hi there! I am Ziniu WU. I am working on [Mixed Reality-based Robotic Manipulation and Robot Learning](https://robodd.github.io/site/research/). Previously, I received an MSc in Robotics at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and a BSc in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en).

<!--
Ziniu Wu is a first-year PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Bristol, working with Dr. Bahadir Kocer and Prof. Arthur Richards. His research focuses on **Continual Learning for Dynamical Systems** to enhance their adaptation and robustness in unconstructed and dynamic environments. Previously, he received an MSc in Robotics at the University of Bristol and a BSc in Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool.
