I am pursuing M.Sc. degree in Robotics at the University of Bristol, starting from September 2022. I received the B.Sc. degree with honours in Applied Mathematics from the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and University of Liverpool in July 2022. I am actively seeking for a Ph.D. opportunity in the area of robotics.
