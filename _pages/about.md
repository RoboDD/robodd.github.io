Hi! I am Ziniu WU. I am a Research Intern with [Dr. Dandan Zhang](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/about) at the [Multi-Scale Embodied Intelligence Lab (MEIL)](https://www.intelligentrobotics-acrossscales.com/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), working on [Mixed Reality-based Bimanual Robotic Manipulation](https://robodd.github.io/site/research/). Previously, I received an MSc in Robotics at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and a BSc in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/).

My Research Interests
======

I have broad research interests in **Dynamical Systems** and **Spatial Mathematics**. Now I am mainly interested in:

* Continual Learning
* Imitation Learning
* General World Models
* Human-Robot Value Alignment
* Dynamics Modelling and Optimization
* Motion Planning and Control

Just for fun:

* Robotic Manipulation and Teleoperation
* Immersive Technologies in Robotic Applications
