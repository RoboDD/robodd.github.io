**Email:** ashleybrookcohen@gmail.com

**Twitter:** @ashbc1988

**Bio:**  I am a PhD candidate in biogeochemistry at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University, NY in Dr. Gordon Taylor‚Äôs Marine Microbial Ecology laboratory. I specialize in the geobiology, or the interaction of geochemical processes and microbes, of oxygen-free environments. My dissertation work at Fayetteville Green Lake, NY, is focused on how the succession of microbial carbon fixation pathways and sulfur metabolisms along redox gradients influences stable isotope signatures. I am especially interested in how they are compartmentalized into suspended and sinking particulate matter in the water column, and ultimately, what is incorporated into sediment. I hope this will provide insight into which early earth anoxic water column processes are reflected in the geologic record. I combine microbiology techniques including Illumina sequencing, stable isotope probing, radiotracer rate measurements, qPCR, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with geochemical techniques to answer these questions.

**Bio:** I love viruses! Except for Coronaviruses. I don't love those. I'm a jack of all trades working on bacteria and viruses in the ocean and in soil. I live and breathe metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and stable isotope probing, but dabbled in amplicon work in the past. Most of all I like to know everything about interactions between viruses and their hosts, and some day it will be my main field. For now I'm a postdoc in Mary Firestone's lab. Show me your cats and dogs and we will be the best of friends.

**Bio:** I am bioinformatician at the University of Montana. My research interests span from geomicrobiology to bacterial endosymbiosis. My current research involves using a variety of phylogenetic approaches, as well as functional annotation, comparative genomics, and transcriptomics to better understand genomic and cellular adaptations of bacteria as they transition from a free-living to an intracellular lifestyle. I am also very interested in functional annotation more broadly, and currently developing a bioinformatics platform to allow researchers to carry out a more-targetted approach to functional annotation, using smaller and more-curated datasets that address specific questions or pathways (e.g. biofilm formation, motility, iron cycling, magnetosome formation, etc.).

**Bio:** I am currently working as a postdoctoral scholar in the Interface Geochemistry group of Liane G. Benning at the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ in Potsdam, Germany. Part of my research in this group is to understand the role that biology plays on glacier melt dynamics. While we study all manner of microorganisms that live on glaciers, we are particularly interested in snow and ice algae and their impact on changes to glacial albedo and carbon transformation processes. We use a variety of techniques to answer our research questions including targeted amplicon sequencing, metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing, and metabolomics. Our current focus is on glacial ecosystems in Iceland and Greenland.

**Bio:** I am a PhD student in the Jill Banfield and Dave Savage groups at UC Berkeley. The current toolkit for human genome editing could be dramatically expanded through the exploration of new CRISPR-Cas and associated proteins that have yet to be characterized, and through the development of enzymatic tools to enable controlled repair of DNA breaks. My PhD thesis aims to advance the science and technology of genome editing by discovering and harnessing new CRISPR-Cas and related systems through a combination of bioinformatics and biochemistry.
