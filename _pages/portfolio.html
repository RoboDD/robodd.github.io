                <b>Apple Counting using Machine Vision</b><br>
                <b>MSc Group Project - EMATM0056 Machine Vision</b><br>
                Description: It is crucial to have an accurate and reliable image-based fruit detection system to support more hierarchical agricultural tasks such as yield mapping and Robo-Harvest. This project applies the Minneapple dataset instead of physical data collection experiments, and designs, implements and evaluates the use of conventional image processing based apple counting methods and an advanced object detection framework Mask R-CNN for orchard apple detection. In particular, Mask R-CNN replaces RoI Pooling with RoIAlign and adds a branch in the classifier stage for removing the mask of the object, which solves the problem of inconsistency between the candidate and ground truth boxes caused by RoI Pooling using two integerizations. In terms of apple detection results the conventional image processing method is able to identify most of the apples in the image, but is unable to distinguish apples on the ground from those on the trees; Mask R-CNN is able to identify more accurately through extensive training, and performs well even on highly obscured fruit. The mean accuracy of the conventional image processing method is calculated to be 45.5%, while the mean accuracy of Mask R-CNN is 59%.

                <b>Serial and Parallel Robot Modeling and Analysis</b><br>
                Description: This report is the coursework for Robotic Fundamentals and is divided into three main sections: Lynxmotion Arm, Planar Parallel Robots and Optimisation-based Trajectory Generation. In Section 1, we first define a forward kinematic model of the five-degree-of-freedom Lynxmotion Arm by Modified DH representation and analyse the reachable workspace of its wrist. We then generate an inverse kinematic model of the Lynxmotion Arm by geometric method. Finally, we apply the obtained forward and inverse kinematic models to plan three trajectories between five positions (free motion, straight line and obstacle avoidance). In Section 2, we first derive the inverse kinematic model of the planar parallel robot, which is similar to the delta robot, by the vector method. We then use the algebraic method to solve the expression for its workspace and the root formula for the quadratic function to determine whether it is a real solution. Inspired by the trajectory planning in Section 1, we introduce in Section 3 a minimumsnap trajectory generation scheme for robot arm in the geometric space that allows the selection of the optimal coefficients of the polynomial as a quadratic planning problem. A numerical example is given to validate the method in one dimension. It ends with a conclusion and references. Almost all the codes in the paper can be found in appendices.

                <b>PID and LQR Control for Line Following: Performance Evaluation and Analysis</b><br>
                Description: The aim of this report is to evaluate the performance of PID and LQR control methods for robot heading control in line following challenge. The full and comprehensive code for these two algorithms is implemented on the nonholonomic differential drive robot and the 3Pi+ robot is tested in the different settings of parameters and maps. This report finally presents the results of our experiments and compares the performance and discusses the performance of controllers and analysis of errors. The LQR-based method performs stable behavior rather than PID.
