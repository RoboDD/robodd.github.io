## Roadmap

<img src='/site/images/myresearch.drawio.png' width = "100%" align=center>

## Project I: Virtual Reality-based Teleoperation

Features:

- Immersive and intuitive direct control in the master-slave fashion
- Fully ROS based for modularized development
- Fundamental tools for collecting robot training data without Sim2Real gap

Short demo for tidy-up task:

Limitation:

- The degree of freedom of the "wrist" is reduced, 7-DoF arm will be used later.


<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-check"></i> Next:
- safety consideration design
- adopt to cloud computing framework
- Mixed reality-based teleoperation
- Integrate with mobile manipulator: improve mobility
- enhance user experience (Jitter removal, trajectory smooth)
- trajectories optimization using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
- add point cloud rendering, and extra modules (Point Clouds Completion)
- Gaze track and rough approach
- Gimbal camera (mount camera on 6DOF mycobot to provide immersive view)?
- Digital twin feedback?
- a user-friendly IK solver? (no strange pose)
- add 6 DOF object detection?
- add tactile feedback?


## Project II: X-aware Shared Control (Human-in-the-loop)

X=communication, intention, reaction, uncertainty, interaction, privacy, change, energy, context, safety

## Project III: Robot Learning: Imitation Learning and DRL

## Project IV: Dexterous Contact-Rich Bimanual Manipulation
