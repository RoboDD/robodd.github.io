## Autonomous Docking for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV)

- Remote control by human operators is often required to complete the re-docking of the USV to the docking station after the operations;
- It is a challenge for the unmanned deployment of fully autonomous USVs. Therefore, we address the last-mile problem: autonomous docking;
- More details are coming soon!

## Mixed Reality-based Fully Immersive Teleoperation for Robotic Manipulation (MSc Dissertation)

- Developed a fully immersive teleoperation framework (MR-PT) for teleoperation using ROS, Unity and Quest Pro;
- Conducted user studies to quantitatively demonstrate that MR-PT outperforms the benchmark methods;
- Performed extensive real-world experiments using the Kinova Gen 3 robot and MyCobot 320 arm;
- Implemented quadratic programming for motion control (QPMC) in both Isaac Sim and Kinova Gen 3.

- Awarded the [Most Accomplished Project]() award at the Robot Demo Day from the University of Bristol;
- Contributed to [HuBotVerse project](https://sites.google.com/view/iohirtplusmr/home) as a core team member which led to the acceptance of a publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine (RA-M).

## Optimization-based Motion Planning Algorithms for Quadrotors (BSc Final Year Project)

- Systematically reviewed the motion planning methods, including graph search, sampling-based, optimization-based;
- Implemented path search on a grid map using A* and back-end optimization to generate minimum-snap trajectory;
- Conducted high-fidelity simulations using AirSim, Python and Matlab to quantitatively evaluate the performance;


## Motion Planning and Control for Unmanned Surface Vehicles

- Implemented an improved artificial potential field (APF) method for USV obstacle avoidance using Python and ROS;
- Developed a river bank following local planner based on the point clouds, and validated in Gazebo simulator (VRX);
- Analyzed, evaluated and discussed experimental data involving MATLAB and Python (seaborn, etc.)


## Development of Micro Aerial Vehicle for On-site Water Sampling (SURF)

- Developed and tested a micro aerial vehicle to collect water samples in complicated on-site water environments;
- Designed and manufactured the foldable airframe structure and modular sampler structure using SolidWorks;
- Assembled and configured the quadrotor with PX4 Autopilot and peripherals, including GPS, telemetry, etc;
- Developed a PX4 module based on Nuttx to remotely control water sampler using uORB and MAVLink;
- Implemented a position-based vision servoing for the precise landing in ROS using OpenCV and ArUco markers.
