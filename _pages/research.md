# Milestone I: Virtual Reality-based Manipulation for Tidy Up

Features:

- Immersive and intuitive direct control in the master-slave fashion
- Fully ROS based for modularized development
- Fundamental tools for collecting robot training data without Sim2Real gap

Short demo:

Limitation:

- The degree of freedom of the "wrist" is reduced, 7-DoF arm will be used later.


<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-check"></i> Next:
- safety consideration design
- adopt to cloud computing framework
- Mixed reality-based teleoperation
- Integrate with mobile manipulator: improve mobility
- enhance user experience (Jitter removal, trajectory smooth)
- trajectories optimization using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
- add point cloud rendering, and extra modules (Point Clouds Completion)
- Digital twin feedback?
- a user-friendly IK solver?
- add 6 DOF object detection?
- add tactile feedback?


# Milestone II: X-aware Shared Control (Human-in-the-loop)

X=communication, intention, reaction, uncertainty, interaction, privacy, change, energy, context, safety

# Milestone III: Robot Learning: Imitation Learning and DRL

# Milestone IV: Dexterous Contact-Rich Bimanual Manipulation
