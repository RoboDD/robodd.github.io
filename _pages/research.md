## Autonomous Docking for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV)

- Remote control by human operators is often required to complete the re-docking of the USV to the docking station after the operations;
- It is a challenge for the unmanned deployment of fully autonomous USVs. Therefore, we address the last-mile problem: autonomous docking;
- More details are coming soon!

## Mixed Reality-based Fully Immersive Teleoperation for Robotic Manipulation (MSc Dissertation)

- Developed a fully immersive teleoperation framework (MR-PT) for teleoperation using ROS, Unity and Quest Pro;
- Conducted user studies to quantitatively demonstrate that MR-PT outperforms the benchmark methods;
- Implemented a self-supervised learning-based visual servoing with minimal human-in-the-loop demonstrations;
- Performed extensive real-world experiments using the Kinova Gen 3 robot and MyCobot 320 arm;
- Implemented quadratic programming for motion control (QPMC) in both Isaac Sim and Kinova Gen 3.
