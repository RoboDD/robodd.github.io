Towards Human-in-the-loop Robot Learning with Mixed Reality-based Immersive Teleoperation
{: .notice}

<!---
## Roadmap

## <i class="fa-duotone fa-flag-pennant"></i> Mixed Reality-based Immersive Teleoperation for Manipulators

<img src='/site/images/teleoperation-system.png' width = "80%" align=center>

Features:

- Immersive and intuitive direct control in the master-slave fashion
- Fully ROS based for modularized development
- Fundamental tools for collecting robot training data by human demonstration

Short demo for tidy-up task:

Limitation:

- The degree of freedom of the "wrist" is reduced, 7-DoF arm will be used later.


<i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-check"></i> Next:
- ~~safety consideration design~~ by adding joint limits through finalIK
- ~~Mixed reality-based teleoperation~~
- ~~adopt to cloud computing framework~~ adopted to IoRT framework
- Implementation with Kinova Arm
- switch to 'Articulation' version, IK required
- enhance user experience (Jitter removal, trajectory smooth)
- trajectories optimization using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
- add point cloud rendering, and extra modules (Point Clouds Completion)
- Gaze track and rough approach
- Gimbal camera (mount camera on 6DOF mycobot to provide immersive view)?
- Digital twin feedback?
- a user-friendly IK solver? (no strange pose)
- add 6 DOF object detection?
- add tactile feedback?
- Integrate with mobile manipulator: improve mobility
- uses URP instead of the default render pipeline for better graphical performance?
