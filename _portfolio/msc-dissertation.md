Now, I am working on MSc dissertation. The topic of my MSc dissertation is Teleoperation with Shared Autonomy through Mixed Reality of Mobile Manipulator, supervised by Dr. Dandan Zhang and Prof. Nathan Lepora. The aim of my MSc dissertation is to enhance the performance of mobile manipulation in unstructured and dynamic environments with human-robot shared autonomy. The primary objective is to develop a human-in-the-loop teleoperation method with human-in-the-loop embodied intelligence, enabling mobile manipulators to collaborate with human operators using shared autonomy and high situational awareness while reducing the human supervisory workload. 

The specific objectives of the proposed research are listed below:


* Conduct a review of the current state-of-the-art and representative work carried out on mixed reality-based teleoperation and relevant AI techniques;
* Develop a simulator of mobile manipulators using Unity-Robotic-Hub for quick testing;
* Develop a teleoperation software with shared autonomy using mixed reality (MR) interface for mobile manipulator teleoperation;
* Integrate software with the Robot Operating System (ROS) for teleoperation, perception, planning and control for mobile manipulators;
* Reproduce Object-Centered Teleoperation of Mobile Manipulators With Remote Center of Motion Constraint as the baseline model;
* Designing, developing, testing, and deploying the proposed systems in both simulation platforms and on-site experiments with a user study to evaluate the task completion performance, user experience and human workload.
