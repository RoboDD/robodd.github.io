Title: Experiments and Evaluation of the Impact of Yoga Demonstration Robots on User Satisfaction, Involvement, and Relaxation Compared to Video-based Demonstration

Abstract: Yoga exercise has positive effects on mental and physical well-being. Humanoid robots are being used as yoga coaches to enhance user experience, showing potential for increased social interaction, engagement, and motivation. Our project aims to examine the impact of robot-based yoga poses demonstrations compared to video-based approaches on user experience. 16 participants were divided into two groups to take part in the experiment, which gave feedback by a modified version of the UEQ-S questionnaire. Through the statistical analysis, The results indicate that the robot group rated higher in attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty compared to the video group. Therefore, the robotbased approach improves satisfaction, greater engagement and increased relaxation.
