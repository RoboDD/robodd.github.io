Part A: Drone Preflight Checks

Part B Scenario: Air-to-air Tanker Refueling System
Air-to-air Tanker Refueling System (ATRS) involves transferring aviation fuel from a tanker aircraft to a receiver aircraft while they are both flying [1]. ATRS is an essential process that helps to increase the range, endurance and flexibility of military aircraft. With the development of intelligent information system, we need to design the BDI based intelligent information system using Jason to schedule air refueling [2,3]. Suppose there are one aerial tanker (KC-135) and three receiver aircraft (F35) in the air. Each receiver aircraft has unique identification number. Three receiver aircraft are running out of fuel, and they may need to refuel from the aerial tanker based on current fuel percentage (0 for empty and 100 for fuel). The aircraft broadcasts a requesting to refuel if its fuel is not already full. The aerial tanker sends a decision whether accepting or rejecting refueling requests based on the remaining fuel and the availability of refuel port. For example, KC-135 Stratotanker has one refuel port and it can refuel an aircraft each time. We assume that aerial tanker has a limited amount of fuel and can only refuel one receiver aircraft at the same time.
