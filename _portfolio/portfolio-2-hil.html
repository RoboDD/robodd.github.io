My potential research interest is human-in-loop planning and control for aerial swarms. The long-term goal is to reduce heavy supervisory work from human operators and improve the capability of aerial swarms to complete comprehensive missions. I am interested in applying both model-based, data-driven, or combinations of both approaches to solve the challenge. The novel human-robot control paradigm has wide applications in automotive cars, military drones, and construction robotics, which can improve the level of autonomy of the next generation of robotics systems.
