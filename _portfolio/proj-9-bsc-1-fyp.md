Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of motion planning algorithms for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), especially quadrotors. Motion planning is an essential module to plan feasible motions that connects the initial state and the desired state while satisfying the required constraints. Motion planning systems may be divided into two parts, the front-end path search and the back-end trajectory optimization. Firstly, this report presents the A* path search algorithm to find collision-free path on graph-based map. Secondly, this report delivers optimization-based algorithms that generate optimal piece-wise polynomial trajectories through a path, while minimizing the snap (the 4th derivative of position) and satisfying derivative and continuity constraints. Motivation, methodology, problem formulation, numerical results and performance analysis are discussed in detail. Further, insights about limitations of motion planning methods are revealed.

Keywords: motion planning, quadrotor, path finding, trajectory generation, trajectory optimization.
