Abstract: Simulation calculation plays a key role in the studies of lithium-ion batteries due to its advantage of low cost, time saving but systematic prediction and design. In this project, properties of lithium-ion batteries, such as charging/discharging characteristics and thermal behaviors, are studied by mathematical modeling with COMSOL’s Multiphysics software. We use COMSOL to simulate the 2D and 3D models of lithiumion batteries, and get the results of particle distribution and temperature distribution after the batteries react. The battery model is further optimized by adding thermal management system to improve efficiency and to prolong service life of the battery.
