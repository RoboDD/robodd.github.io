abstract = {Pathfinding in uniform-cost grid environments is a problem commonly found in application areas such as robotics and video games. The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A*by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.

abstract = {Quadrotors are among the most agile flying robots. However, planning time-optimal trajectories at the actuation limit through multiple waypoints remains an open problem. This is crucial for applications such as inspection, delivery, search and rescue, and drone racing. Early works used polynomial trajectory formulations, which do not exploit the full actuator potential because of their inherent smoothness. Recent works resorted to numerical optimization but require waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints at specific discrete times. However, this time allocation is a priori unknown and renders previous works incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories. To generate truly time-optimal trajectories, we propose a solution to the time allocation problem while exploiting the full quadrotor's actuator potential. We achieve this by introducing a formulation of progress along the trajectory, which enables the simultaneous optimization of the time allocation and the trajectory itself. We compare our method against related approaches and validate it in real-world flights in one of the world's largest motion-capture systems, where we outperform human expert drone pilots in a drone-racing task.},

abstract = {We present an optimization-based framework for multicopter trajectory planning subject to geometrical configuration constraints and user-defined dynamic constraints. The basis of the framework is a novel trajectory representation built upon our novel optimality conditions for unconstrained control effort minimization. We design linear-complexity operations on this representation to conduct spatial-temporal deformation under various planning requirements. Smooth maps are utilized to exactly eliminate geometrical constraints in a lightweight fashion. A variety of state-input constraints are supported by the decoupling of dense constraint evaluation from sparse parameterization, and backward differentiation of flatness map. As a result, this framework transforms a generally constrained multicopter planning problem into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. Our framework bridges the gaps among solution quality, planning efficiency, and constraint fidelity for a multicopter with limited resources and maneuvering capability. Its generality and robustness are both demonstrated by applications to different flight tasks. Extensive simulations and benchmarks are also conducted to show its capability of generating high-quality solutions while retaining the computation speed against other specialized methods by orders of magnitude.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework to do optimal time allocation for quadrotor trajectory generation. Using this method, we can generate minimum-time piecewise polynomial trajectories for quadrotor flights. We decouple the quadrotor trajectory generation problem into two folds. Firstly we generate a smooth and safe curve which is parameterized by a virtual variable. This curve named spatial trajectory is independent of time and has fixed spatial properties. Then a mapping function which decides how the quadrotor moves along the spatial trajectory respecting kinodynamic limits is found by minimizing total trajectory time. The mapping function maps the virtual variable to time is named temporal trajectory. We formulate the minimum-time temporal trajectory generation problem as a convex program which can be efficiently solved. We show that the proposed method can corporate with various types of previous trajectory generation method to obtain the optimal time allocation. The proposed method is integrated into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform and is validated by presenting autonomous flights in indoor and outdoor environments. We release our code for time optimization as an open-source ros-package.},

@article{Sun2021,
abstract = {Accurate trajectory tracking control for quadrotors is essential for safe navigation in cluttered environments. However, this is challenging in agile flights due to nonlinear dynamics, complex aerodynamic effects, and actuation constraints. In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art control frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the differential-flatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of agile trajectories at speeds up to 20 m/s (i.e.,72 km/h). The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We show the superiority of NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner-loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world's largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner-loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.},

@article{Penicka2022,
abstract = {We tackle the problem of planning a minimum-time trajectory for a quadrotor over a sequence of specified waypoints in the presence of obstacles while exploiting the full quadrotor dynamics. This problem is crucial for autonomous search and rescue and drone racing scenarios but was, so far, unaddressed by the robotics community in its entirety due to the challenges of minimizing time in the presence of the non-convex constraints posed by collision avoidance. Early works relied on simplified dynamics or polynomial trajectory representations that did not exploit the full actuator potential of a quadrotor and, thus, did not aim at minimizing time. We address this challenging problem by using a hierarchical, sampling-based method with an incrementally more complex quadrotor model. Our method first finds paths in different topologies to guide subsequent trajectory search for a kinodynamic point-mass model. Then, it uses an asymptotically-optimal, kinodynamic sampling-based method based on a full quadrotor model on top of the point-mass solution to find a feasible trajectory with a time-optimal objective. The proposed method is shown to outperform all related baselines in cluttered environments and is further validated in real-world flights at over 60 km/h in one of the world's largest motion capture systems. We release the code open source.},

The flight plan includes different types of waypoints to join, while respecting flight corridors and bounds on the derivatives of the position of the quadrotor. To this aim, non-uniform clamped B-splines are used to parameterize the trajectory. The latter is computed in order to minimize its overall duration, while ensuring the validation of the waypoints, satisfying the flight corridors and respecting the maximum magnitude on its derivatives. A receding waypoint horizon is used in order to split the optimization problem into smaller ones, which reduces the computation load when generating pieces of trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed trajectory generation technique is demonstrated by simulation and through an outdoor flight experiment on a quadrotor.},

@article{Aggarwal2020,
abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important problems to be explored in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for finding an optimal path between source and destination. Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers.},

To assess the effect of heuristic functions for path planning algorithms, four commonly used heuristic functions of Manhattan distance, diagonal distance, Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance are used based on three simulation environments with different map size and complexity. Experimental results show that the heuristic function significantly affects the computing performance and the final path of path planning algorithms, and Manhattan distance is the most efficiency heuristic function for all the four path planning algorithms. We apply A*, D*, LPA* and D* Lite algorithms to static and dynamic environments, respectively with different map size and complexity. We find that A* has the best performance in relatively simple static environments. When the map size and complexity of the static environment is highly increased, D* Lite is the best choice. In contrast, D* Lite has the best performance for path planning in dynamic environments. However, we also find that A* also has an excellent performance in dynamic environments when the map size and complexity are decreased.},

Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

abstract = {We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments. In such settings, it is necessary to allow for significant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justified for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The key objective of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning is to produce a flight path that connects a start state and a goal state while meeting the required constraints. Computational intelligence (CI) is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches for addressing complex real-world problems for which mathematical or traditional modelling does not perform well. It has been applied in the field of UAVs since it can yield effective, accurate and rapid solutions. This article provides an overview of studies on UAV path planning based on CI methods published in major journals and conference proceedings. We survey relevant studies with respect to different CI algorithms utilized in UAV path planning, the types of time domain in UAV path planning, namely, offline and online, and the types of environment models, namely, 2D and 3D. It is observed that CI methods outperform traditional methods on online and 3D problems. The analysis is useful for identifying key results from UAV path planning research and is leveraged in this article to highlight trends and open issues.},

@phdthesis{Michael2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},
