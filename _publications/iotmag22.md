Abstract: Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for urban services has been an exciting topic in today’s urban planning and management research. Most UAVs use unlicensed spectrum for remote control and communications. Their communication distance is limited within a few hundred meters; and the control channel is prone to interference. In comparison, urban cellular networks can cover a wide urban area with a low chance of interference, making them a viable alternative for UAVs on services that require real-time and reliable connections. In this article we provide a performance evaluation of this concept. We first address some key challenges in designing and implementing a UAV platform connected to cellular networks. The cellular networks include 4G and 5G. Then we use the platform to test the actual performance of 4G and 5G in urban areas with a focus on their signal strength and packet delay. A comparative analysis reveals the benefits 4G and 5G can bring to UAVs in urban flights.
