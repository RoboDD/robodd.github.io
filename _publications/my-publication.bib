  title={Connect Your UAV to the Cloud Using Urban 4G and 5G Cellular Networks: Performance Evaluation and Comparison}, 
  year={2022},
  abstract={Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for urban services has been an exciting topic in today's urban planning and management research. Most UAVs use unlicensed spectrum for remote control and communications. Their communication distance is limited within a few hundred meters; and the control channel is prone to interference. In comparison, urban cellular networks can cover a wide urban area with a low chance of interference, making them a viable alternative for UAVs on services that require real-time and reliable connections. In this article we provide a performance evaluation of this concept. We first address some key challenges in designing and implementing a UAV platform connected to cellular networks. The cellular networks include 4G and 5G. Then we use the platform to test the actual performance of 4G and 5G in urban areas with a focus on their signal strength and packet delay. A comparative analysis reveals the benefits 4G and 5G can bring to UAVs in urban flights.},

ABSTRACT = {Path-keeping requires unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to follow a planned path in autonomous navigation. It is essential for USVs to carry out autonomous tasks such as collecting various data of water quality and surrounding terrain for exploration and protection of water environments. However, due to obstacle avoidance and other factors such as wind, water waves, and dynamics of USVs, USVs usually deviate from the original planned path during autonomous navigation. This paper proposes a novel path-keeping algorithm based on the artificial potential field method (PK-APF) for USVs. To minimize the deviation between the actual path and the original planned path, the vertical distance and the virtual foot points of the current position of USVs to the original path (a line connecting the previous navigation point and the next navigation point) are calculated. When the vertical distance is larger than a threshold, we regard the vertical foot point as a virtual goal point to guide the USVs to navigate the original path in real-time to achieve high-precision path-keeping. Obstacle avoidance is simulated in the MATLAB and Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulators, and the influence of wind and water waves is considered in VRX. Experiments are conducted in typical scenarios and results show that PK-APF outperforms the traditional APF by at least 22%. The work provides an important basis for real-life environments. Substantial further work is planned for applying the method on a physical USV.},
