As the rapid development of autonomy in robotics, mobile robots have been more and more involved in our daily life. Robotics improve the working efficiency and replace the labor of humans in various missions, such as disaster response, aerial videography, field surveillance, and search-and-rescue. To fulfill the gap between theory and practice, this introductory-level course will discuss about the basic concepts of modern robotics, including robotic components, dynamic modelling, perception, planning, control, with brainstorm, numerical simulation, and hands on practice. By attending courses, completing experiments and comprehensive project, you can have a good picture about robotic system development.
